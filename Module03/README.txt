The ZIP file contains the /OpenGameList/ folder, which contains a Visual Studio 2015 solution containing 12 sub-projects (one per chapter).

Ideally, you should put the content of the /OpenGameList/ folder in the GitHub repository on your choice.

Be sure to add a .gitignore file to ignore the same contents that are specified in the .hgignore file.
I suggest to leave the .hgignore file too for those who will use Mercurial/HG.

These represents the various "stages" of the application, from Chapter 01 to Chapter 10.

Each project can be opened independently using the included OpenGameList_ChapterXX.sln file, 
or they can be opened alltogheter within a single solution using the OpenGameList.sln file.

Some chapters (3 and 5) have two projects each, splitted into Part 1 and Part 2, because they both contain a huge code refactoring.

The project ending with _Chapter10 is meant to be the "final" source code of the application by the end of the book.
